You may study this blade. You may forge your own. But if you show your new blade to the world, you must also share the secrets of its forging, just as I have shared mine.

*Kono yaiba o manabi, mizukara no mono o kitae yo. Saredo yo ni shimesu naraba, waga gotoku, sono hiden o mo wakachi-au beshi.*
 
この刃を学び、自らのものを鍛えよ。されど世に示すならば、我が如く、その秘伝をも分ち合うべし。
